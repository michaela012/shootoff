# shootoff

Game Rules:
Bullets: -/3

Moves:
Reload - +1 bullets
Shoot - 1 action cost, shoots the other player
Block - 0 action cost, blocks shoot
Reflection - 1 action cost, reflections the shot back if the other player shoots
Kill shot- 3 action cost, pierces through block, pierces through reflection?

Fast paced rounds, decision based game

Visually I imagine it as like a pokemon battle:
5 moves at the bottom, 3 second timer, bullets displayed at the bottom, should you be able to see the other players bullets?
